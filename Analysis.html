<h1>Prediction-Assignment-Writeup (ML)</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> August 01, 2024</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the realm of wearable fitness technologies like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, there exists an opportunity to gather substantial personal activity data affordably. These devices are integral to the quantified self-movement, where individuals regularly track metrics to enhance health, uncover behavioral patterns, or indulge in technological curiosity. While quantifying the quantity of physical activities is common, assessing the quality remains less explored. This project utilizes accelerometer data from various body locations (belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell) of 6 participants. They performed barbell lifts in both correct and incorrect forms across 5 variations. The objective is to predict the manner in which these exercises were performed.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The training data for this project can be accessed <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The test data are available <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The data originate from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har">this source</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>The first step in the analysis was to load the data and perform preprocessing to clean the dataset. Unnecessary variables were removed, and columns with a significant proportion of missing data were discarded. This step is critical as it ensures that the models are trained on the most relevant features.</p>

<pre><code># Load necessary libraries
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(kernlab)

# Read data files
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

# Data Preprocessing
training <- training[,-c(1:7)]  # Remove metadata columns
training <- training[, colMeans(is.na(training)) < 0.9]  # Remove columns with &gt;90% missing data

# Remove near-zero variance variables
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[,-nzv]
</code></pre>

<h3>Training and Validation Split</h3>
<p>To evaluate the models, the dataset was split into a training set and a validation set. This helps in assessing the model's performance on unseen data and aids in the selection of the best-performing model.</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(42)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=F)
subTrain <- training[inTrain,]
validation <- training[-inTrain,]
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Fitting and Cross-validation</h2>
<p>Several models were evaluated, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVM-RBF), and Neural Networks. The models were tuned using 5-fold cross-validation, which is a standard technique to estimate the generalization error of a model.</p>

<h3>Random Forest</h3>
<p>The Random Forest model was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with many variables. The model's accuracy and confusion matrix were evaluated to determine its performance.</p>

<pre><code># Random Forest Model
set.seed(42)
train_control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter=FALSE)
rf_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="rf", trControl=train_control)

# Prediction and Confusion Matrix
rf_pred <- predict(rf_model, validation)
rf_CM <- confusionMatrix(rf_pred, factor(validation$classe))
rf_CM
</code></pre>

<h3>Support Vector Machine with RBF Kernel</h3>
<p>The Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was also tested. SVMs are powerful classifiers, especially in scenarios where the data is not linearly separable.</p>

<pre><code># SVM Model
svm_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="svmRadial", trControl=train_control, verbose=FALSE)

# Prediction and Confusion Matrix
svm_pred <- predict(svm_model, validation)
svm_CM <- confusionMatrix(svm_pred, factor(validation$classe))
svm_CM
</code></pre>

<h3>Neural Network</h3>
<p>The Neural Network model was the final model tested. Neural networks are highly flexible and can capture complex patterns in data, though they require more computational resources.</p>

<pre><code># Neural Network Model
nn_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="nnet", trControl=train_control, trace=FALSE)

# Prediction and Confusion Matrix
nn_pred <- predict(nn_model, validation)
nn_CM <- confusionMatrix(nn_pred, factor(validation$classe))
nn_CM
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Selection</h2>
<p>After evaluating all the models, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy and the lowest expected out-of-sample error. The table below summarizes the accuracy and expected out-of-sample error for each model.</p>

<pre><code>models <- c("Random Forest", "SVM-RBF", "Neural Network")
accuracy <- c(rf_CM$overall[1], svm_CM$overall[1], nn_CM$overall[1])
oos_error <- 1 - accuracy

data.frame(Model = models, Accuracy = accuracy, `Expected OOS Error` = oos_error)
</code></pre>

<h2>Prediction on Test Set</h2>
<p>The final step was to use the chosen model (Random Forest) to predict the outcomes on the test set. These predictions will be used to assess the model's performance on new data.</p>

<pre><code>pred_test <- predict(rf_model, testing)
pred_test
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this project, multiple machine learning models were evaluated for the task of predicting the manner in which exercises were performed using accelerometer data. The Random Forest model was selected as the best-performing model due to its high accuracy and robustness. The next steps involve refining the model further, possibly exploring ensemble methods, and deploying it in a Shiny app for real-time predictions.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Additional Analysis and Visualizations</h2>
<p>To provide a deeper understanding of the data and model performance, the following sections include detailed visualizations and additional analysis.</p>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the distributions, relationships, and patterns within the dataset. The histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices below provide insights into the data's structure.</p>

            }
        }
    }
});
