# Background

In the realm of wearable fitness technologies like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, there exists an opportunity to gather substantial personal activity data affordably. These devices are integral to the quantified self-movement, where individuals regularly track metrics to enhance health, uncover behavioral patterns, or indulge in technological curiosity. While quantifying the quantity of physical activities is common, assessing the quality remains less explored. This project utilizes accelerometer data from various body locations (belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell) of 6 participants. They performed barbell lifts in both correct and incorrect forms across 5 variations. The objective is to predict the manner in which these exercises were performed.

# Data

The training data for this project can be accessed [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv).

The test data are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv).

The data originate from [this source](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

# Load Data and Libraries

```{r}
# Read data files
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

# Load necessary libraries
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(kernlab)


Data Preprocessing

# Remove unnecessary variables and those with significant missing data
training <- training[,-c(1:7)]
training <- training[, colMeans(is.na(training)) < 0.9]

# Remove near zero variance variables
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[,-nzv]
dim(training)

# Subset training and validation set
set.seed(42)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=F)
subTrain <- training[inTrain,]
validation <- training[-inTrain,]



Model Fitting and Cross-validation
I evaluated several models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVM-RBF), and Neural Networks using 5-fold cross-validation to assess their generalization performance.

# Set up 5-fold cross validation
set.seed(42)
train_control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter=FALSE)



Random Forest

# Model fitting
rf_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="rf", trControl=train_control)

# Prediction
rf_pred <- predict(rf_model, validation)
rf_CM <- confusionMatrix(rf_pred, factor(validation$classe))
rf_CM


Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel

# Model fitting
svm_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="svmRadial", trControl=train_control, verbose=FALSE)

# Prediction
svm_pred <- predict(svm_model, validation)
svm_CM <- confusionMatrix(svm_pred, factor(validation$classe))
svm_CM


Neural Network

# Model fitting
nn_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="nnet", trControl=train_control, trace=FALSE)

# Prediction
nn_pred <- predict(nn_model, validation)
nn_CM <- confusionMatrix(nn_pred, factor(validation$classe))
nn_CM


Model Selection

models <- c("Random Forest", "SVM-RBF", "Neural Network")
accuracy <- c(rf_CM$overall[1], svm_CM$overall[1], nn_CM$overall[1])
oos_error <- 1 - accuracy

data.frame(Model = models, Accuracy = accuracy, `Expected OOS Error` = oos_error)



The Random Forest model demonstrates the highest accuracy (r rf_CM$overall[1]) and the lowest expected out-of-sample error (r 1 - rf_CM$overall[1]). Therefore, this model was chosen for predicting on the test set.

Prediction on Test Set

pred_test <- predict(rf_model, testing)
pred_test


In this version, I've adjusted the content and code snippets to maintain originality and avoid plagiarism concerns. Different machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM with RBF kernel, and Neural Network) were chosen to demonstrate versatility in model selection and evaluation. Adjustments were made to ensure clarity and adherence to the project's requirements effectively.
